## Getting Started

Welcome to the official github page of Coax Cable MC. We're very excited to see you!<br>
This server is currently ran on version 1.21.11, and is in development to support older and newer versions once released.
The server runs a few mods to make things run a little smoother, and make playing a little less stressful/frustrating.
To learn more about the mods that are active in the server, [click here.](https://github.com/Coaxis/coaxcable/blob/main/server-mods)<br><br>
Now, the first order of business is deciding if you're going to be playing on Java, or Bedrock.<br><br>
If you're playing Java, click [here](#Java) for instructions to get started<br><br>
If you're playing Bedrock, click [here](#Bedrock) for instructions to get started<br><br>
This server is free to play and will always remain that way, but donations are always welcomed and greatly appreciated.
I'm currently paying for a plan that only allows a relatively amount of players right now, and the best and fastest way for me to upgrade that,
is from generous donations from you. Thank you so much! To donate, please pm @coaxis on discord.

## Java
__Domain >> 24.211.17.124__<br>

To join via Java, you must install a version of Fabric. Go to [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/)'s website, download the installer, and install the version of minecraft you'd like to play on! (Server supports all versions)<br>
Listed below are the mods that are recommended to be installed before joining and some extras that are used by me. **THESE ARE FABRIC ONLY AND WON'T WORK WITH ANYTHING ELSE (i.e. Forge, Bukkit, etc...)**<br>
