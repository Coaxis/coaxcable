Welcome to the official github page of Coax Cable MC. We're very happy to see you!
This server is currently ran on version 1.21.4, and is in development to support older (and newer versions once released).
The server runs a few mods to make things run a little smoother, and make playing a little less stressful/frustrating.
To learn more about the mods that are active in the server, [click here.]()<br>
Now, the first order of business is deciding if you're going to be playing on Java, or Bedrock.<br>
If you're playing Java, click [here](#Java) for instructions to get started<br>
If you're playing Bedrock, click [here](#Bedrock) for instructions to get started<br>
This server is free to play and will always remain that way, but donations are always welcomed and greatly appreciated.
I'm currently paying for a plan that only allows a relatively amount of players right now, and the best and fastest way for me to upgrade that,
is from generous donations from you. Thank you so much! To donate, please pm @coaxis on discord.

## Java
To join via Java, it's very simple. There are a few options I will provide for users joining who might want to enhance their experiences.
If you just want to play off the normal installation provided by the Minecraft installer, here are all of the details for server login<br>
__Domain >> coaxcable.mcserver.io__<br>
__Port >> 25685__<br>
For those who would like to spice things up a little bit, I recommend going to [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/)'s website, downloading the installer, and installing version 1.21.4.<br>
Listed below are the mods that I currently run on my machine. **THESE ARE FABRIC ONLY AND WON'T WORK WITH ANYTHING ELSE (i.e. Forge, Bukkit, etc...)<br>

[Mods - Extras](extras.zip)<br>
